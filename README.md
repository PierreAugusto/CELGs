## Abstract: 
We propose 4MOST/LRS observations of 523 compact emission-line galaxies (CELGs), local analogues of high-z star-forming systems that are systematically missed by spectroscopic surveys due to their star-like morphology. Our candidates are selected from S-PLUS imaging, using their strong [OIII] emission at zâ‰ˆ0.3 to overcome this selection bias. This program will build the first large, spectroscopically-confirmed catalogue of this unexplored population. Our primary goals are to: (1) secure definitive redshifts; (2) characterize ionization sources and levels using key diagnostic lines ; and (3) determine physical properties, including SFRs, gas-phase metallicities, and stellar masses, to probe the drivers of compact starbursts and their evolutionary role across cosmic time.
# README: CELGs Target Catalog for 4MOST

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains astronomical targets selected for observation with the 4MOST spectrograph (4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope). The file [`4MOST_targets_CELGs.fits`](4MOST_targets_CELGs.fits) includes a compilation of 523 candidate Compact Elliptical Galaxies (CELGs) with their celestial coordinates, magnitudes, and other properties relevant for spectroscopic observations.

## FITS File Structure

The main file [`4MOST_targets_CELGs.fits`](4MOST_targets_CELGs.fits) contains a binary table with multiple columns describing the properties of the target objects. The data is formatted according to 4MOST requirements for observation proposals.

## Scientific Context

This catalog was compiled as part of a project studying compact emission galaxies. These objects are targets for the 4MOST telescope, a high-resolution multi-object spectrograph installed.

4MOST will conduct several spectroscopic surveys, and this catalog was prepared as part of a proposal for supplementary observation time. All targets comply with the specific requirements of 4MOST for scientific proposals, including the standard target catalog format.

## Target Selection Criteria

The CELG candidates in this catalog were selected from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Data Release 4, covering 3000 square degrees of the southern sky. The selection process was designed to ensure a clean and reproducible sample of compact galaxies with emission lines at $z \approx 0.3$.

**Key selection steps:**

- Identification of objects with flux excess in the narrowband J0660 of S-PLUS, sensitive to [OIII]$\lambda5007$ emission redshifted.
- Selection of sources with a magnitude contrast of at least 0.5 mag in J0660 relative to the continuum (estimated using the broadband $r$ and $i$ filters).
- Morphological cut to ensure compactness: elongation between 0.75 and 1.25 and small angular size (FWHM $<$ 2.5 pixels in the $r$ band).
- Selection of objects classified as galaxies (stellar probability $<$ 25%) with photometric redshifts $0.25 < \mathrm{photo\_z} < 0.35$.
- Magnitude range $15 < r < 20.5$ and high-quality photometry ($\mathrm{SEX\_FLAGS} \leq 3$).
- Removal of artifacts and objects contaminated by nearby sources using aperture photometry.

The process was validated through pilot spectroscopy with Gemini/GMOS, confirming the observed candidates as compact star-forming galaxies at the expected redshift. This demonstrates the robustness and homogeneity of the final sample of 523 candidates included in this catalog.
